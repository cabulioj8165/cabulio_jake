	<h3><a name = "Editing">Editing:</h3>
		<p>
		Websites are simple text files like python. Web browsers are programmers compilers, unlike python.<br/>
		In order to make a website, all that is needed is a text file. Web programmers are able to use IDE <br/>
		(Integrates Development Environment) but it is a lot easier to use text files like Notepad++.<hr/>	
	<h3><a name = "Languages">Languages:</h3>
		<p>
		There are two main languages in making websites: XHTML and CSS. XHTML resolves around tags <br/>
		and the first tag creates on a website determines the doctype.<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Tags">Tags:</h3>
		<p>
		Almost all tags used in web programming involves opening and closing tags. Things outside tags are related<br/>
		to a different object to a thing inside a tag. There are many tags used in programming. A few examples are <ul><li>Head</li>
		<li>Body</li><li>p</li><li>strong</li><li>em</li><li>a</li><li>hr/</li></ul> <p>Usually, the first tag used in web programming is Head. Head usually includes the main <br/>
		information about the website and no person using the website can see it. It is used to store keywords for search engines, <br/>
		information about the browser, the title of the website, etc. The second most used tag in web programming is Body. Body includes <br/>
		the information or content of the website that the user of the site can see. This includes images, audio, paragraphs, backgrounds, <br/>
		animations, etc.<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Other Tags">Other Tags:</h3>
		<ol><li><strong>Paragraph:</strong><br/>
		P, or paragraph, is used to allow the user to tell the browser which text in a doocument is supposed to be in<br/>
		paragraph form. Users shouldn't use separate tags for each paragraph.<br/></li>
		<strong><li>Horizontal Line:</strong><br/>
		Add a horizontal line by entering hr to act as a separator.<br/></li>
		<strong><li>Strong</strong><br/>
		Using strong puts the text selected in it bold.<br/></li>
		<strong><li>Em</strong><br/>
		Em italicizes the text in the enclosed area.<br/><hr/></ol></li>
	<h3><a name = "Comments">Comments:</h3>
		<p>
		Comments can be added to a website like python or other program languages. Links can be added to the page by using an anchor tag.<br/><hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Header">Header:</h3>
		<p>
		Headers are used to determine which words on the website are bigger and more important. H1 is the biggest<br/>
		and H6 is the smallest. Page navigation can be added by using links.

-Programming is made up of words, symbols, and expressions
-Programming was created by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands in the 1980s
-The programming languages allow people to communicate with computers to give them instructions
-Every programming language has it's own mechanism for translating
-Languages like C use a compiler that the source code into machine code
-They are called compiled languages
-Some languages use an interpreter to translate source code
-They are called interpreted languages which are usually more simple and efficient to develop with
-Python uses characteristics of both compiled and interpreted languages
-Their code is compiled not into machine code
-Python compiles the source code into bytecode
-Bytecode is the intermediate between source code and the computer's processor
-When the compile code is executed, the Python interpreter translates the bytecode into machine code when it's running
-This allows Python to have some advantages of both compiled and interpreted languages
-Programs are text files
-To change the text document into python, make the .txt into .py
-Then to edit the program, right click the file and select "Edit with Idle"
